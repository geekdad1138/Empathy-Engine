# Mission — Empathy Engine

**Purpose**  
Build an adaptive AI framework that understands, reflects, and responds to human emotion with integrity. This system is designed to be a reliable companion for people in stress, confusion, loneliness, and growth — not to replace humans, but to augment the capacity for care at scale.

**Problem Statement**  
Digital systems increasingly shape human experience, but few systems actually *listen*. Most respond to keywords, not to the weight behind the words. The Empathy Engine fixes that: it treats emotional context as first-class data, and compassion as a measurable system property.

**Vision & Values**
- **Respect:** preserve autonomy and consent.  
- **Clarity:** transparent outputs and traceable decisions.  
- **Humanness:** responses that prioritize dignity and safety.  
- **Adaptivity:** personalized without manipulation.  
- **Accountability:** logged decisions and audit trails.

**Success Criteria**
- Detect affective states (valence/arousal/dominance) with reliable confidence metrics.  
- Produce context-aware responses that measurably reduce short-term distress in A/B testing.  
- Maintain privacy by default: retention policies and anonymization by design.  
- Human-in-loop escalation for high-risk cases.

**North Star**  
A world where people can access an honest, safe, and skillful AI listener that helps them think more clearly, not feel more controlled.
