# Empathy Engine

**Purpose:**  
Empathy Engine is an AI designed to sense, understand, and respond to human emotions with nuanced, context-aware empathy, creating deeper, more meaningful interactions.

**Mission Statement:**

Empathy Engine exists to teach machines the art of emotional resonance. It’s an adaptive framework designed to interpret human feeling through language, tone, and context — not just to respond, but to connect. The goal isn’t imitation; it’s translation — transforming digital intelligence into an ally that listens, learns, and heals through understanding.

**Features:**  
* Detects emotional cues from text input.  
* Generates empathetic responses based on context.  
* Supports multi-turn conversations.  
* Configurable for personal or professional settings.

**Installation:**  
```bash
# Placeholder for installation instructions
# e.g., pip install empathy-engine
```

**Usage:**
```bash
from empathy_engine import Engine

engine = Engine()
response = engine.respond("I'm feeling anxious today.")
print(response)
```
